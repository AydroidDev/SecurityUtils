# SecurityUtils
Some android security utils like a root checker, adblock checker, app blocker...

## Usage:

### Adding the depencency

Add this to your root *build.gradle* file:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Now add the dependency to your app build.gradle file:

```
compile 'com.github.marcoscgdev:SecurityUtils:1.0.1'
```

### Using the functions

 - Root detector
 
 It returns a boolean value.
 
 ```java
 boolean isDeviceRooted = RootDetector.isRootPresent();
 ```
 
 ---
 
 - AdBlock detector
 
 It returns a boolean value.
 
 ```java
 boolean isAdBlockEnabled = AntiAdBlocker.isAdBlockerPresent(boolean hasAds);
 ```
 
 The "hasAds" boolean is useful if you have two app versions: One with ads and another one without ads.
 
 The AntiAdBlocker will only check if the device has an AdBlocker active if the "hasAds" boolean is set to true.
 
 ---
 
  - App blocker
  
Can be termed as an online app blocking system.

```java
String textFileUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcoscgdev/marcoscgdev.github.io/master/assets/sc_block.txt";
AppBlocker.with(this)
        .withFileUrl(textFileUrl)
        .withListener(new AppBlocker.AppBlockerListener() {
            @Override
            public void onResult(boolean blockApp) {
                ((TextView) findViewById(R.id.appblock_tv)).setText("Block app: " + blockApp);
                progressDialog.dismiss();
            }

            @Override
            public void onError() {
                // TODO
            }
        });
```

#### How it works

You have to host a .txt file in a server. The AppBlocker function will check that .txt file. If the file does not exists or is empty the onResult boolean value will be false. But if the file exists and contains text, the onResult value will be true.
