# SecurityUtils
Some android security utils like a root checker, adblock checker, app blocker...

## Usage:

### Adding the depencency

Add this to your root *build.gradle* file:

```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Now add the dependency to your app build.gradle file:

```
compile 'com.github.marcoscgdev:SecurityUtils:1.0.1'
```

### Using the functions

 - Root detector
 
 It returns a boolean value.
 
 ```java
 boolean isDeviceRooted = RootDetector.isRootPresent();
 ```
 
 ---
 
 - AdBlock detector
 
 It returns a boolean value.
 
 ```java
 boolean isAdBlockEnabled = AntiAdBlocker.isAdBlockerPresent(boolean hasAds);
 ```
 
 The "hasAds" boolean is useful if you have two app versions: One with ads and another one without ads.
 
 The AntiAdBlocker will only check if the device has an AdBlocker active if the "hasAds" boolean is set to true.
